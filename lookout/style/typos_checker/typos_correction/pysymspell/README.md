PySymSpell
---

PySymSpell is a pure Python port of [SymSpell](https://github.com/wolfgarbe/SymSpell).

Version 6.1 implemented. That is both the improved lookup and lookupCompound-method.

Please note that this port is this [Java port](https://github.com/Lundez/JavaSymSpell) rewritten in python with minimal changes and requires severe refactoring. Also this is alpha version and therefore lacks documentation, tests, designed speed and style.
